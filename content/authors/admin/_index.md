I am a science and technology enthusiast. As a biochemist, I developed a particular interest in health sciences and pharmacology. More recently, during my master's degree in Bioinformatics, I discovered a new passion in data analysis and statistical programming software. I have knowledge of different programming languages like R, Python, Matlab and MySQL. I am a creative and determined professional, so I like to embrace new challenges, be attentive to details and find efficient solutions.
